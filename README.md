# 📊 Streamgraph Visualizer

A minimal yet powerful Python script that creates beautiful **streamgraphs** using sine and cosine waves. This project leverages `matplotlib` and `numpy` to visually demonstrate layered data with a flowing "wiggle" baseline.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Visualizes streamgraphs using sine and cosine curves.
- Clean and modern chart with customizable data.
- Black background and vibrant waves for impactful visuals.

## 🖼️ Preview

A dynamic streamgraph of sine and cosine waves.

## ✏️ Customization

You can modify the `x`, `y1`, and `y2` arrays in the script to plot your own data layers:

```python
x = np.linspace(0, 20, 200)
y1 = np.sin(x)
y2 = np.cos(x)
```
