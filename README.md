# 📊 Streamgraph Visualizer

A minimal yet powerful Python script that creates beautiful **streamgraphs** using sine and cosine waves. This project leverages `matplotlib` and `numpy` to visually demonstrate layered data with a flowing "wiggle" baseline.

## 🔍 Features

- Visualizes streamgraphs using sine and cosine curves.
- Clean and modern chart with customizable data.
- Black background and vibrant waves for impactful visuals.
